# next-reverse-proxied

my boilerplate for a quick and easy docker container with ssl and cache

## features

- [ssl-proxy](https://github.com/suyashkumar/ssl-proxy) - for taking the headaches out of certbot 
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/) - for caching the apps responses !speed! !speed! !speed!
- [node](https://nodejs.org/) - this example uses a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app. it could be any framework

## usage

this is still a work in progress.  like the nginx isn't tuned.  

check back later for usage instructions.
